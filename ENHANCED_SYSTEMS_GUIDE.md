- Memory leak identification (>10% memory usage)
- Process recovery recommendations
```

#### **5. Filesystem & Storage Health**
```bash
# Storage monitoring

```

#### **6. Security & Access Monitoring**
```bash
# Security oversight
- Failed login attempt monitoring (>5/hour alerts)
- Active user session tracking
- UFW firewall status verification
- Security event logging
```

### **🔍 HEALING INTELLIGENCE:**
- **Connection-Aware**: Never restart services you're connected through
- **Graduated Response**: Monitor → Warn → Heal → Report
- **Safety First**: Conservative approach for critical services
- **Detailed Logging**: All actions logged with severity levels
- **Recovery Verification**: Confirms healing actions worked

## 📅 **AUTOMATED SCHEDULES**

### **🕐 ACTIVE CRON JOBS:**
```bash
# Current automation
*/10 * * * * advanced-health-monitor.sh    # Every 10 minutes
0 1 * * * enhanced-system-backup.sh        # Daily at 1:00 AM PST

# Verify with: crontab -l
```

### **⏰ TIMING RATIONALE:**
- **Health Monitoring**: 10 minutes = responsive without being excessive
- **System Backup**: 1:00 AM PST = minimal impact, reliable timing
- **Resource Efficient**: Scripts optimized for minimal system impact
